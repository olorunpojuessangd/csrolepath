# CS RolePath

**CS RolePath** is a prototype application designed to increase transparency around Computer Science labor roles at Berea College. The project explores how clear, structured information about role expectations, prerequisites, and progression can help students make more informed decisions—without relying on informal insider knowledge.

This repository represents an early-stage implementation scaffold exported from Figma and is under active development.

## Project Motivation

At Berea College, many CS labor opportunities are learned about informally—through peers, faculty conversations, or prior experience. While role descriptions exist, they are often fragmented, implicit, or difficult to compare. This can create uncertainty, especially for:

* First-year students
* First-generation and international students
* Students early in their CS coursework
* Students unsure how specific roles connect to long-term goals

CS RolePath aims to make these pathways **visible, comparable, and understandable**, emphasizing readiness and progression rather than ranking or competition.

## What CS RolePath Explores

The prototype focuses on four core ideas:

* **Explicit expectations**
  Clear descriptions of what each role involves, what skills are developed, and who typically succeeds.

* **Guided exploration**
  Onboarding questions help narrow options based on experience level, interests, and time constraints.

* **Role comparison**
  Side-by-side comparisons support informed choice rather than optimization or recommendation.

* **Pathway visibility**
  “What typically comes next” sections surface how roles connect to future opportunities.

## Current State

This repository contains:

* A Vite-based frontend scaffold exported from Figma
* Initial static layouts representing:

  * Landing page
  * Onboarding flow
  * Role exploration
  * Role detail views
  * Role comparison
  * Reflection modal

At this stage:

* The application is **not yet fully interactive**
* Logic, state management, and data integration are still in progress
* Usability testing has been conducted on the prototype to inform future iterations

---

## Usability Testing

Initial usability tests were conducted with Berea College students using think-aloud walkthroughs. Early findings suggest:

* The onboarding flow is intuitive and aligns with students’ mental models
* Role detail and comparison views support understanding and decision-making
* Opportunities exist to improve action clarity (e.g., next steps, apply pathways)
* Users expect stronger affordances around clickability and continuity

Further testing is planned as development continues.

---

## Tech Stack (Current)

* Vite
* TypeScript
* HTML / CSS

This stack reflects the initial export and will evolve as functionality is implemented.

---

## Running the Project Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Future Work

Planned next steps include:

* Implementing interactive onboarding logic
* Improving role comparison mechanics
* Strengthening calls to action and next-step clarity
* Conducting additional usability tests with a broader range of students
* Iterating on the interface based on feedback
* Preparing the application for deployment

Development will continue over the winter term.

## Status

This project is an **exploratory prototype** developed as part of a Human-Centered Computing / Design course at Berea College. It prioritizes clarity, equity, and student agency over completeness or polish.

Perfection is not the goal—iteration is.
